    <p>The following are the terms of service (“Terms of Service”) that define the relationship between Apparent Technologies LLC. (doing business as Apparent (“Company,” “Apparent,” “we,” or “us”)) and you, and govern your use of Apparent’s services.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in Apparent, which owns and operates the services offered on beapparent.com (“Apparent Website”) and any associated mobile applications (“Apparent Apps”) or products and services that Company may provide now or in the future (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
    <p>When using the Service, you will also be subject to the Apparent Privacy Policy and any posted guidelines, policies or rules applicable to specific features of the Apparent Website or Apparent App, which may be posted from time to time (collectively the “Guidelines”). These Terms of Service, including any other Guidelines and future modifications (collectively, the “Agreement”), govern your use of the Service and is a legal contract between you and Apparent. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms of Service and any of the Guidelines, the additional Guidelines will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. By registering for an account on, or otherwise accessing or using the Apparent Service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of an institution that has a separate written agreement with Apparent, that agreement governs your use of the Service.</p>
    <p>
      <b>If you are under the age of 18 you don’t have permission to use the Service.</b>
    </p>
    <p>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms “you”, “your” or “Member” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the Service.</p>
    <p>By using or signing up for Apparent, you agree to these terms. Welcome to the community!</p>
    <h3>Using the Service</h3>
    <h4>Permission to use Apparent</h4>
    <p>As long as you are complying with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company gives you permission to access and use the Service that you select through the applicable registration process. The Service is available for your personal, non commercial use.</p>
    <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether, including, for example, if you do not comply with this Agreement or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. You can stop using our Service at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. We may also stop providing the Service to you, or add or create new limits to our Service or restrict your access to all or a part of the Service at any time without notice or liability. Access to and use of the Service itself is free, but in the future, we may offer new or additional special features which Apparent may charge for. Please also be aware that while we currently provide our mobile services for free, your carrier’s normal rates and fees still apply, such as text messaging and data fees.</p>
    <p>We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service. Please see our FAQ for more information. The right to access and use the Service is revoked in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited, if any.</p>
    <h4>Restrictions</h4>
    <p>Except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, you agree that your permission to use the Service is conditioned upon you following all the restrictions set forth in the “Apparent Technology” and “Acceptable Use and Conduct” sections.</p>
    <h4>Your Information and Content Ownership</h4>
    <p>In the course of using the Service, you and other users may provide or post certain content or information (including, but not limited to, photos, videos, music, messages sent between parents and teachers, and feedback), which may be used by Apparent in connection with the Service and which may be visible to certain other users (collectively “User Submissions”). Please visit our Privacy Policy for additional information on the types of information different types of users are able to provide. Additionally, some User Submissions may be deemed an Education Record (as defined below).</p>
    <p>You retain all ownership rights you have in any User Submissions. Apparent does not claim any ownership rights in the User Submissions. Please note that, while you retain ownership of your User Submissions, any template or layout in which you arrange or organize such User Submissions through tools and features made available through any of our Service are not proprietary to you — rights to such templates or layouts will remain with us.</p>
    <h4>License</h4>
    <p>In order to allow Apparent to provide the Service, you hereby grant to us a limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable (as necessary to perform the Service), worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable (only to a successor) right and license to (i) use, copy, store, distribute, publicly perform and display, modify, and create derivative works (such as changes we make so that your content works better with our Service) such User Submissions as necessary to provide, improve and make the Service available to you and other users, including through any future media in which the Service may be distributed, (ii) use and disclose metrics and analytics regarding the User Submissions in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in improving our service or in marketing and business development purposes), (iii) use any User Submission (including any Education Record) that has been de-identified for any product development, research or other purpose; and (iv) use for other purposes permitted by the Apparent Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Company will only share and use your personal information in accordance with Apparent’s current Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>The license in (i) above will terminate when you delete any User Submissions with intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) (“IP content”)), you or your Institution (as defined below) deletes an Education Record, you delete any personal information, or you delete your account, unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you post a User Submission, this can be viewed by other teachers, school leaders and parents and it means that you are allowing others to access and use that information and to associate it with you (i.e. your name and profile picture if you provide one as a teacher or parent). Note, however, that any User Submissions that may be in or related to messages sent through Apparent may be kept after you delete your account. When you delete IP content, Education Records, or personal information, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer. However, you understand that any removed User Submission may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
    <h4>Your Responsibilities and Apparent’s Rights</h4>
    <p>You are responsible for making sure that you have all rights in the User Submissions, including the rights necessary for you to grant us the foregoing licenses to the User Submissions. You are responsible for ensuring your User Submission complies with the “Acceptable Use and Conduct” Section and for any other guidelines or conditions specific to a particular category of user (e.g., teacher, parent, or school leader). When you include User Submissions, you can create links to external websites. If you elect to create links to external websites, you must verify the quality and substance of each external link. You are solely responsible for any links you create to external websites. Apparent is not liable or responsible for any links created by you, or for any damages, direct or indirect, arising therefrom.</p>
    <p>All information posted or transmitted through the Service is the responsibility of the person that posted it, and we will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content. Apparent cannot guarantee the identity of any other users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Service, or the authenticity of any data which users may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all content accessed by you using the Service is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. You acknowledge that Apparent and its designees reserve the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, filter, remove, refuse to accept, post, display, or transmit any User Submission through or on the Service in whole or in part at any time for any reason or no reason with or without notice and without liability of any kind. Additionally, we do not guarantee that we will publish any of your User Submissions, and reserve the right to remove User Submissions from the Service at any time for any reason, such as if we receive a notice reports a User Submission infringes someone’s intellectual property rights.</p>
    <h4>Analyzing User Submissions</h4>
    <p>Our automated systems analyze your User Submissions (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, and for spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored. Apparent will not analyze any personal information contained in Educational Records for the purpose of providing behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or parents. The foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit Apparent from marketing or advertising directly to parents so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of personal information contained in Educational Records to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising.</p>
    <h4>Feedback</h4>
    <p>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Apparent, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them.</p>
    <h4>Privacy and Security</h4>
    <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us, and we take great care to limit what we collect and how we use it, and to enable you to understand our policies. Please read our Privacy Policy which explains how we treat your personal information and protect your privacy when you use our Service. Please see our Privacy Policy for a description of the procedures 1) by which a parent or legal guardian of a student may review, access or delete the personal information of a student; and 2) by which the Institution may access and delete Education Records. Additionally, please see our Privacy Policy for more information on the administrative, technical and physical safeguards we maintain to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to personal information. By using our Service, you agree that Apparent can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We won’t reduce your rights under the Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.</p>
    <h4>Additional Terms by User Type</h4>
    <p>a) Teachers, school leaders and any school-based organization, including but not limited to, Parent Teacher Association, Parent Teacher Organization or similar school based organization with a mission to make the school a better place for children to learn and the parent volunteers that represent said organizations (“School Personnel”): accessing the Service on behalf of a school, school district, or other similar educational institution (the "Institution"), the following terms apply to you:</p>
    <p>(i) Permissions and Authority: You agree that you are acting on behalf of (or have permission from) your Institution to enter into this Agreement and to use the Service. Only School Personnel who are current employees of the Institution may use the Service on the Institution's behalf. The School Personnel is responsible for obtaining any necessary approvals from their school's authorities and administrators before using the Service. Upon termination of a School Personnel or other staff member's employment with the Institution, such individual must return and cease using all login details he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn a user of the Service claims to be affiliated with your Institution who is not, in fact, affiliated with your Institution, you will notify Apparent immediately.</p>
    <p>(ii) All User Submissions submitted for display on the Service directly by you must be reviewed by you in accordance with, and are subject to, this Agreement, including those terms and conditions set forth in the “Acceptable Use and Conduct” and “Your Information and Content” Sections. You are solely responsible for reviewing all User Submissions prior to these being posted and are also solely responsible for all submitted content (including any personal information contained therein if not removed by you), and for ensuring that such submissions meet all applicable conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those in “Your Information and Content” and the “Acceptable Use and Conduct” Sections.</p>
    <h4>FERPA</h4>
    <p>Apparent understands that it is important that our partner schools comply with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA") and related regulations. Certain information that may be provided to Apparent by School Personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an Institution, may be considered an education record (“Education Record”) under FERPA. Additionally, certain information, provided to Company by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA (“Directory Information”) and thus not an Education Record. A school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information ("PII") from an eligible student’s education records to a third-party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA (“FERPA Exemption(s)”), including the exemption for Directory Information (“Directory Information Exemption”) or disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest (“School Official Exemption”).</p>
    <p>As School Personnel or an Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to Apparent, you represent, warrant and covenant to Apparent, as applicable, that your Institution has:</p>
    <p>(i) complied with the Directory Information Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Institution deems to be directory information and may be disclosed and allowing parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools not disclose directory information about them; and/or</p>
    <p>(ii) complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their annual notification of FERPA rights that the Institution defines “school official” to include service providers and defines “legitimate educational interest” to include services such as the type provided by Apparent; or</p>
    <p>(iii) obtained all necessary parental written consent to share the Directory Information and Educational Records with Company, in each case, solely to enable Company’s operation of the Service.</p>
    <p>It is important that School Personnel not provide information to Apparent from any parent that has opted out of the disclosure of Directory Information. Apparent depends on our school partners to ensure that the school is complying with the FERPA provisions regarding the disclosure of Directory Information or the School Official Exemption for any student information that will be shared with Apparent. Apparent is not in a position to provide legal advice regarding whether the school's existing FERPA disclosures are sufficient. To the extent that School Personnel have questions regarding these issues, they should consult the school's legal counsel for more information.</p>
    <p>Apparent will never share PII contained in Education Records with third parties except (i) as directed by a Apparent user (i.e., teacher sharing with another teacher or parent); or (ii) to our service providers that are necessary for us to provide the Service, as stated in our Privacy Policy. PII contained in Education Records are never used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising to parents. Additionally, personal information provided about a student is never sold or rented to anyone. This section shall not be construed to prohibit Apparent from marketing or advertising directly to parents or other users so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of PII contained in Educational Records to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising.</p>
    <p>Apparent may use Directory Information and Education Records that have been de-identified for product development, research or other purposes (“De-Identified Data”). De-Identified Data will have all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed, this includes, but is not limited to, name, date of birth, demographic information, location information and school identity. Apparent agrees not to attempt to re-identify the De-Identified Data and not to transfer the De-Identified Data to a third-party unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification.</p>
    <h4>Apparent Technology</h4>
    <p>The Service and the Apparent Technology are intended solely for the personal, non-commercial use of our users and may only be used in accordance with this Agreement. “Apparent Technology” means all past, present and future content of the Service, including, all the software, hardware and technology used to provide the Service (including Apparent proprietary code and third-party software), user interfaces, materials displayed or performed on the Service, such as text, graphics, articles, photographs, images, illustrations and the design, structure, sequence and “look and feel” of the Services, and all other intellectual property, including all Apparent Marks. “Apparent Marks” means the trademarks, service marks, logos, or any other trade name, trademarks, service marks and other distinctive or proprietary brand features of Apparent.</p>

    <h4>Third Parties and User Interactions</h4>
    <p>Content from other users and third parties, including, information about third-party products and services, is made available to you through the Service ("Third-Party Content"). Additionally, the Service may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by Company, and includes features that allow you to interact and communicate with third parties (“Third-Party Websites”). The inclusion of Third-Party Content and links to Third-Party Websites on the Service does not imply our affiliation or endorsement of such Third-Party Content or Third-Party Websites. Because we do not control Third-Party Content or Third-Party Websites, you agree that we are not responsible for any such Third-Party Content or Third-Party Websites, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, legality, usefulness, safety or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Third-Party Content or Third-Party Websites (including privacy policies or opinions expressed on the Third-Party Websites), it is the sole responsibility of the person from which such Third-Party Content or Third-Party Websites originated, and Apparent has no obligation to monitor such Third-Party Content or Third-Party Websites.

Your interactions with Third-Party Content and Third-Party Websites, organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals and are subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline interaction with any other person.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes of a similar effect.</p>
    <h4>Term and Termination</h4>
    <p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service unless your account is terminated as provided in this Agreement (“Term”). You may terminate your use of the Service or your account at any time by contacting us. Company may suspend or terminate your access to the Service or your account at any time, for any reason (without cause or for your violation of any term of this Agreement), and without warning or notice, which may result in the loss of information associated with your account. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>
    <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
    <p>a) Generally: In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
    <p>b) Exceptions: Notwithstanding subsection (a), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
    <p>c) Arbitration: Any arbitration between you and Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company.</p>
    <p>d) Notice; Process: A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Company's address for Notice is: Apparent Technologies LLC 326 E. 82nd st. Apt. 1B New York, NY, United States of America. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.</p>
    <p>e) Fees: In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, NY, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
    <p>f) No Class Actions: you and company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
    <p>The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company's reasonable control. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

Company may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without restriction. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. To the extent any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such claim shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, NY, and for all purposes of this Agreement, you and Company consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Unless and solely to the extent that you or your Institution have a separate written agreement with Company that governs your use of the Service (in which case such agreement will control), we both agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that the Agreement may not be modified, except as otherwise provided herein. This Agreement and any subsequent versions of this Agreement posted to the Website will be deemed a writing signed by both parties. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any respect whatsoever.</p>
