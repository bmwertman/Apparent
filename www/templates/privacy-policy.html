    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>We will only collect, use, and share your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This policy applies whether you use Apparent through our websites (the “Apparent Websites”) or our mobile applications (the “Apparent Apps”), or any of our other products or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service”). In addition, this Privacy Policy also covers Apparent's treatment of any personal information about our users that our partners or other services might share with us.</p>
    <p>This policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that Apparent doesn’t own or control, such as third-party services you might access through links or other features (e.g., social media buttons or YouTube videos) on the Service. These other services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information.</p>
    <p>Whether you are new here (welcome!), or have been using Apparent for a long time (welcome back!), please do take the time to get to know our privacy practices. We think they’re pretty clear and friendly, but if you have any questions, we’re here to help. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h4>What is Apparent?</h4>
    <p>Apparent is a communication platform that, through parent organizations, helps parents be engaged in their child(ren)’s school. They use the Apparent App or the Apparent Website - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other.</p> 
    <p>Parents access and set up an account on Apparent by signing up by providing and verifying their email and setting a password.</p>
    <p>School Leaders also play a meaningful role on Apparent. They can share notes, photos, and videos. Only teachers, parents, and students connected to classes in the school can see these posts. School Leaders can also create classes, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students and message with parents, plus see Highlights - a high-level overview of all the feedback and engagement happening within their school.</p>
    <p>More information on how the Service operates is located here and your participation and use of the Service is governed by our Terms of Service (“Terms”).</p>
    <h4>Push Notifications</h4>
    <p>Apparent may send push notifications to Parents or School Leaders - for example, telling them about an achievement milestone they reached, upcoming events or for event support outreach. Push Notifications may be initiated by Your School’s Parent Organization, School Leaders, General Parent users(in the form of Chat Messages) or by Apparent.</p>
    <h4>What Children’s Information is Visible to Others?</h4>
    <p>Apparent believes that parents are brought together through the friendships and experiences of their child(ren). Information that you provide such as your child(ren)’s name(s), grade level(s), image(s), class(es) or teacher(s) may be used to make connections between You and other Verified Users in your School including Parents and School Leaders.</p>
    <h4>How Long Does Apparent Keep Children’s Information?</h4>
    <p>We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as his or her Parent(s)’ account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms.</p> 
    <p>Minimal information: Apparent collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to use our Service. Information on Students is always collected on a voluntarily from Parent(s).</p>
    <p>Deleting inactive accounts:
    If a Verified User’s account is inactive for twelve months or more (meaning the Verified User has not logged in through the Apparent App or Apparent Website either actively by entering their login or passively by launching the Apparent App or opening the Apparent Website ), Apparent will automatically delete the Verified User’s account, including personal information.</p>
    <h4>What information does Apparent collect?</h4>
    <p>We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the Apparent Service (described below under "Information you provide to us") and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under “Information collected automatically”). The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a parent, school leader or teacher and how they use Apparent (e.g. if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).</p>
    <h4>Information you provide to us</h4>
    <p>There are currently three categories of users on our Service: parents, school leaders, and teachers. We collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:</p>
    <p>Account Sign-up and Profile Information: To create a Apparent account as a parent, school leader or teacher, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo.</p>
    <p>School Information, Collaboration Features and Content: As part of the profile information you provide, you must choose to associate your account with an existing school registered with the National Center for Education and Statistics.</p>
    <p>Inviting Others: As a parent, school leader, or teacher you can invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the Apparent App, for example by email, SMS, or sharing via social media such as Facebook or Twitter. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book.</p>
    <p>Messaging: As a parent, school leader, or teacher you can privately message with individual Verified Users that have signed up for the Service, or send broadcast messages to all Verified Users using Apparent Messaging or Event Management features. We will store messages, including those on Apparent Messaging or Event Management features and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help parents, teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications.</p>
    <p>Contact Information: When you choose to provide us with your personal information through the Service in some other manner (e.g., when you send us an email asking a question, submit a support request, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with Apparent to improve the Service).</p>
    <p>Our use of the information above is described below in the "How Does Apparent Use the Information it Collects” section. If you are using the Apparent App, we may ask you for certain permissions - please click here for more detail about those permissions.</p>
    <h4>Information collected automatically</h4>
    <p>Like most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to Apparent (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use Apparent on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>The technologies and information we automatically collect include:</p>
    <p>Cookies and other similar technologies: We (or our service providers) may use cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in student logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our services that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g. if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site). We don’t allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our service (i.e. such as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but we may serve contextually relevant advertising for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
    <p>Local storage: We may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
    Like many services, Apparent uses these technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information, understand your engagement with the Apparent Website, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.</p>
    <p>Device information: We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve Apparent for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them.</p>
    <p>Mobile application information: Certain mobile applications or “apps” include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Apparent when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the Apparent App, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help with “debugging” and for improvement of the Apparent App.</p>
    <p>Server log information: Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. Examples include things like:</p>
    <p>Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Apparent Website or Apparent App.</p>
    <p>Telephony log information like your phone number and SMS routing information</p>
    <p>IP Address</p>
    <p>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL</p>
    <p>This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular.</p>
    <p>Location information: When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we collect precise geolocation information (“precise” meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you, we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We do not collect precise geolocation data from students. We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geo-location data with third-parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.</p>
    <h4>Information received from third-party sources</h4>
    <p>We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. Local law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us. If we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading "Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information".</p>
    <h4>How does Apparent use the information it collects?</h4>
    <p>First and foremost, you should know that Apparent does not sell or rent any of your, or your child’s, personal information to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Third-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to Apparent and personal information collected about students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). We use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best Apparent experience. More specifically, this information is used to:</p>
    <p>Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features</p>
    <p>Respond to your emails, submissions, questions, requests for information or customer support</p>
    <p>Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it</p>
    <p>Send you information about features on our Service or changes to our policies and Service</p>
    <p>Provide parents and teachers information about events, announcements, offers, promotions, products, including third-party products, and services we think will be of interest to you</p>
    <p>Notify and contact contest and sweepstakes entrants</p>
    <p>Most crucially, to protect our community by making sure the Service remains safe and secure</p>
    <p>We use automatically collected information (described in the "Information collected automatically" section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy. To learn more about how we use your information for personalization and tracking, please see the Online Tracking Technologies Policy.</p>
    <h4>Will Apparent share any information it collects?</h4>
    <p>First and foremost, you should know that Apparent does not sell or rent your (or your child’s) personal information to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Third-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to Apparent and personal information collected about students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). Furthermore, we do not share personal information with any third-parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy:</p>
    <p>Other Users You Share and Communicate with on Apparent: No teacher, school leader or parent profiles are made available to the general public through our Service. If you are a teacher, school leader, or a parent, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other Apparent teachers, school leaders or parents - for example, things like your account information or other information you share with teachers, school leaders, or parents you are communicating with through Apparent Messaging or Apparent Event Management or our other collaboration features.</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that information (including personal Information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other Apparent users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers and school leaders you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information and we are not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of such information or content by others.</p>
    <p>Third-party integrations on our Service: When, as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you invite others via Facebook or Twitter, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing from Apparent. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.</p>
    <p>Service Providers: Third-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to Apparent and personal information collected about students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - we can’t build everything ourselves, after all! We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. Additionally, we may also share information with social networking and other websites, applications or partners, for marketing and advertising our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students). Generally, these service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Additionally, these service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Testimonials: We post testimonials on our Service which may contain personal information such as the name, photo and/or a video of the individual in the testimonial. We obtain the individual’s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly.</p>
    <p>Analytics Services: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. A current list of analytics providers that we use is located here.</p>
    <p>Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information: We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how Apparent is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for Apparent. Any aggregated information shared this way will not contain any personal information.</p>
    <p>Legal Requirements: We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to to protect the rights, property, or safety of Apparent, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our our Terms of Service or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.</p>
    <p>Sharing with Apparent Companies: Over time, Apparent may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Change of control: In the event that all or a portion of Apparent or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party. This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event that Apparent goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third-party.</p>
    <p>With your consent: Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it. Additionally, as discussed above, we will never sell or rent your personal information to advertisers or other third-parties.</p>
    <h4>How does Apparent protect and secure my information?</h4>
    <p>Your Apparent account is protected by a password. You can help us protect against unauthorized access to your account by keeping your password secret at all times. 
    The security of your personal information is important to us. We work hard to protect our community, and we maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to personal information. In particular:</p>
    <p>Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure</p>
    <p>We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems</p>
    <p>We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe.</p>
    <p>We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing</p>
    <p>The Apparent Service is hosted on servers at a third-party facility, with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures. For example, personal information is stored on a server equipped with industry standard firewalls. In addition, the hosting facility provides a 24x7 security system, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems and locked cage areas.</p>
    <p>We automatically delete inactive student accounts after a specific period of time, as per our retention policy.</p>
    <p>For additional information on our security practices, please visit our Privacy Center. 
    Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.classdojo.com) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
    <h4>Can I opt-out of providing information?</h4>
    <p>You can always decline to share personal information with us, or even block all cookies. However, it’s important to remember that many of Apparent’s features may not be accessible, or may not function properly.</p>
    <h4>How can I access and manage my personal information?</h4>
    <p>Apparent aims to provide you with easy access to any personal information we have collected about you. If that information is incorrect, we give you easy ways to update it, or to delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business (e.g., we need at least an email address for your account) or legal purposes.</p>
    <p>Accessing Your Information: Upon request, Apparent will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information, and, if you are a user of Apprent, you may request access to all your personal information we have on file by contacting us. In some cases, we won’t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.</p>
    <p>Managing Your Information: You may update, correct, or delete some of your profile information or your preferences at any time by logging into your account on Apparent and accessing your account settings page. You may have to verify your identity before you can do that.</p>
    <p>We may reject requests for access, change or deletion that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).</p>
    <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, even after you update or delete personal information you have provided us from our Service, your personal information may be retained in our backup files and archives for a reasonable period of time for legal purposes or for so long as is necessary in light of the purposes for which such records were collected or legitimately further processed.</p>
    <h4>How can I delete my account?</h4>
    <p>We hope you love using Apparent now and always. However, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account you can do that at any time by contacting us. If you are a parent, teacher, or school leader using the Account Website, you may also delete your account by logging into your account and accessing your account settings page.</p>
    <p>When you delete your account, we delete your profile information and any other content you provide in your profile (such as your name, username, password, email address, and profile photos). Information that you have shared with others, others have shared about you, or content other users may have copied and stored, is not part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. Additionally, please note, that even if your account is deleted, messages sent are retained for contextual purpose of parents, school leaders and teachers continuing to use the Service. This includes, for example, any content uploaded, including photos and videos.</p>
    <h4>How long does Apparent keep information about me?</h4>
    <p>We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above. Personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services, in which case we will delete prior to you deleting your account.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may have to retain some information after your account is closed, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms. You can, of course, delete your account at any time, as per the "How can I delete my account?" section. Additionally, please note, that even if your account is deleted, messages sent are retained for contextual purpose of parents, school leaders and teachers continuing to use the Service.</p>
    <h4>What communications will I receive from Apparent?</h4>
    <p>If you registered on Apparent, provided an email or phone number to us, or otherwise opted-in to receive communications from us, we may send you messages and updates regarding your account, including privacy and security notices, updates regarding the Service, and information regarding products, features or services from Apparent (or third-parties we believe you may be interested in). These communications may include, but are not limited to, social media updates, SMS/MMS messages, push notifications, email, and postal mail. If you have an account with us, we’ll also use your email address to contact you for customer service purposes, or for any legal matters that arise in the course of business. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your device supports it. We use this confirmation to help us understand which emails are most interesting and helpful.</p>
    <p>If you invite another person to join you on Apparent by providing their email address or phone number, we may contact them regarding the Service using the appropriate form of communication. If they would prefer not to receive our communications, they may opt-out using the “Unsubscribe” or “STOP” instructions contained in those communications.</p>
    <p>You can always unsubscribe from receiving any of our 1) marketing emails or other marketing communications whenever you’d like by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email; 2) marketing SMS texts by replying or texting ‘STOP’ to ‘23656’; or 3) marketing push notifications by turning off push notifications on your device.</p>
    <h4>Social Media Features/Widgets</h4>
    <p>The Service may now or in the future include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and the Twitter Tweet button, or the ability to register on Apparent or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking service, such as through Facebook Connect or Google (collectively "Social Media Features"). These Social Media Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on our Service to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third-party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Additionally, if you decide to register on Apparent through a Social Media Feature, Apparent may also collect personal information that is already associated with your account connected to the Social Media Feature. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Apparent the permission to use, share, and store it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Service. Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing each Social Media Feature. If you are not comfortable accessing such social media websites and using such Social Media Features, please don’t use them!</p>
    <h4>Third-party Services</h4>
    <p>The Service may contain links to websites and services provided by third-parties (e.g. video players). Any personal information you provide on third-party websites or services is provided directly to that third-party and is subject to that third-party’s policies governing privacy and security. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these websites or services. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third-party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you, including if you view a video through an embedded video player which is played off our Service, but may appear to still be playing on our Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party websites or services. We encourage you to learn about third-parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with personal information.</p>
    <h4>How will Apparent notify me of changes to this policy?</h4>
    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy - you can see when the last update was by looking at the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We won’t reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. If we make any significant changes, we’ll provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service and/or notifying you by email (using the email address you provided), so you can review and make sure you know about them.</p>
    <p>In addition, if we ever make significant changes to the types of personal information we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents in order to obtain parental consent or notice for those new practices.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Service. If you don’t agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account (although we’ll be sad to see you go!). By continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h4>What if I’m not in the U.S.?</h4>
    <p>Apparent is hosted and operated in the United States. If you use the Service from the European Union, or any other region with laws governing data collection, protection and use that may differ from United States law, please note that you may be transferring your personal information outside of those jurisdictions to the United States.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, including to the United States, and to the storage of your personal information in the United States, for the purpose of hosting, using and processing the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You further acknowledge that these countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country from which you provided your personal information, and that Apparent may be compelled to disclose your personal information to U.S. authorities. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</p>
    <h4>Canadas</h4>
    <p>We endeavor to provide privacy protection that is consistent with Canada’s private sector privacy laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”). For any questions regarding how we comply with PIPEDA, please contact us.</p>
    <h4>California Privacy Disclosures</h4>
    <p>Do Not Track: Currently, various browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. Apparent does not track its users over time and across third-party websites to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. For more information on “do not track”, please visit www.allaboutdnt.org.</p>
    <p>Third-parties that have content embedded on the Apparent Website, such as a social feature, or an embedded video player, may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a the Apparent Website from a certain IP address. Third-parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Apparent’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.</p>
    <h4>How can I contact Apparent with questions?</h4>
